Cleanup tasks:

- Check package descriptor presence/absence for each command in Fig::Command.
- Clean up method names in Fig::Command, probably by breaking out package loading into a separate class.
- Turn Fig::Options into an object
- Make everything use PackageDescriptors rather than passing name/version/config around.
