v0.1.xx

  - "file:" protocol works for FIG_REMOTE_HOME.

  - Complains if it has nothing to do.

  - Testing no longer requires ssh.


v0.1.41

  - Release cleanup


v0.1.40

  - Works on Mac (in conjunction with libarchive-static 1.0.1).

  - Supports configuration via rc files in JSON format.  These can be (in
    ascending order of priority of values):
      - in the repository under "_meta/figrc"
      - in your home directory in ".figrc"
      - specified on the command-line via the "--figrc" option

    Note that values from all the above locations will be merged into a
    single, net application configuration.  E.g. if
    <repository>/_meta/figrc contains

      {"a" => 5, "b" => 7"}

    and ~/.figrc contains

      {"a" => 37}

    then Fig will see a value for "a" of 37 and a value for "b" of 7.

    Processing of ~/.figrc can be suppressed via the "--no-figrc" option.

  - Supports logging via log4r. Configure via "log configuration" in the rc
    files or via the "--log-config" and "--log-level" command-line options.
    The configuration files must be in XML or YAML format in a way supported
    by log4r and contain configuration for a "fig" logger.  The "--log-level"
    will override any value found in the configuration files.

  - Added additional messages about activity including file download source
    and destination.  Try "--log-level debug".  Suggestions about changes to
    levels that are supported, which levels messages are emitted at, and any
    additional desired logging are welcome.

  - Supports "-v/--version" to emit the Fig version.

  - No longer silently does nothing when no arguments are specified.

  - Start of support for restricting URLs in package.fig files via a URL
    whitelist; not complete yet and will likely change.

  - RSpec usage has been upgraded to v2.
