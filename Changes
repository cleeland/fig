v0.1.58.alpha.2

  - The test suite passes on MS Windows!

v0.1.58.alpha.1

  Backwards incompatibilities:

  - Specifying a config in the descriptor and --config is now an error, i.e you
    can't do:

        fig package/1.2.3:some_config --config some_other_config

    Allowing configurations in both locations was ambiguous and the developers,
    let alone users, couldn't tell which configuration would prevail.

  New features:

  - "--list-variables" option.  This will display all variables manipulated by
    Fig, following package dependencies recursively.  Can have
    "--list-all-configs" and "--list-tree" applied to it for tracking down
    where that nasty setting of EDITOR to "emacs" comes from.

    Example "--list-variables --list-tree" output:

        A/1.2.3
        |   CLASSPATH = something:$CLASSPATH
        |   FROM_A    = blah
        '---C/5.6.7
        |       CLASSPATH = something_else:$CLASSPATH
        |       FROM_C    = blah
        '---B/1.2.3
                CLASSPATH = planet_x:$CLASSPATH
                FROM_B    = blah

    See README.md for more.

    Suggestions for changes to the output format welcome.

  - "--command-extra-args" option.  Allows you to say that the rest of the fig
    command-line is to be appended to the end of the command in a "command"
    statement.

  - The .fig file created in a repository now contains metadata about
    the publishing of the package (time/user/host).

  - Logging output is colorized if going to a tty on *nix.  This includes
    restoration of the old colorization of local package downloads/deletions.
    Colors are not currently configurable.

  - The primary package is now treated the same as other packages as far as
    updates are concerned.  Previously, if you started with a new environment,
    e.g. FIG_HOME was empty, running "fig foo/1.2.3 -- echo foo" would fall
    over.  Even asking for updates ("fig --update foo/1.2.3 -- echo foo")
    wouldn't change anything.  Now the latter case will work.

  Significant Internals:

  - The definition of a package descriptor has become more restrictive in the
    Ruby code.  This shouldn't be an issue because the Treetop grammar has
    already restricted it this way; this is just a check from the Ruby side.

v0.1.57

  - Logging output now goes to stderr by default, instead of stdout.

v0.1.56.alpha

  - Test release

v0.1.55

  - "include" of another package without specifying a version is now a warning
    about its ability to work is dependent upon include ordering.

v0.1.54

  - Emits an error when you've got an "include" of another package without
    specifying the version.  It used to be the case that you could leave the
    version off, but that would only work if there was a "current" version of
    the depended upon package published.  Which meant that you'd have to
    --force the publication of the "current" version.

v0.1.53

  - Fix bug in doing "fig -u" when the remote repository has a figrc file.

v0.1.52

  Notice:

  A lot of internal changes have been made to make future changes easier and
  test coverage is significantly better than it was before.  We believe that we
  haven't broken anything (other than the purposeful changes below), but due to
  the scope of the changes, we may have done so.  Please report any problems
  you run into.

  Backwards incompatibilities:

  - Now requires at least ruby v1.8.7.

  - You can no longer run a command without using "--".  Through an accident of
    implementation, you previously could do

        fig echo foo

    You are now required to run this as

        fig -- echo foo

  - You can no longer specify multiple --clean or --list-configs options.

  - There was partial support for overridding the local location of a package
    via a "fig.properties" file in the current directory.  A full
    implementation of this type of thing may come in the future, but for the
    time being, in the efforts of making the code clean, this is gone.

  - Development now requires at least rspec 2.8.

  New features:

  - "--list-dependencies" option.  This will list all dependencies a given
    package has, recursively.

    For example, if you have package A which depends upon packages B and C
    which both depend upon package D, running

        fig --list-dependencies A/1.2.3

    will give you

        B/2.3.4
        C/3.4.5
        D/4.5.6

    If you additionally specify "--list-tree", you'll get a nested dependency
    tree:

        fig --list-dependencies --list-tree A/1.2.3

        A/1.2.3
            B/2.3.4
                D/4.5.6
            C/3.4.5
                D/4.5.6

    If you don't specify a package descriptor, but you've got a package.fig
    file in the current directory with the same dependencies as package A
    above, you'll get

        fig --list-dependencies --list-tree

        <unpublished>
            B/2.3.4
                D/4.5.6
            C/3.4.5
                D/4.5.6

    If there are no dependencies, you don't specify "--list-tree", and stdout
    is connected to a terminal:

        fig --list-dependencies package-with-no-dependencies/1.2.3

        <no dependencies>

    However, if stdout is not connected to a terminal:

        fig --list-dependencies package-with-no-dependencies/1.2.3 | cat

        [no output]

    Additionally, you can specify "--list-all-configs"; this will follow all
    the configurations in the base package.  Note that this will show multiple
    versions of the same package if different configurations depend upon
    different versions.

v0.1.51

  - You can now set an environment variable to the empty string with "set".

  - Fix bug with same env variable in both APPEND and RETRIEVE statements,
    causing Fig to attempt to retrieve libs intended for publish. (The bug
    was introduced in 0.1.49, in commit aa3f3ab6c7, while fixing another bug).

v0.1.50

  - Trying to get releases via rake to work properly for multiple platforms.

v0.1.49

  - Finalizing figrc name for URL whitelist.

v0.1.47-48

  - Exception, regex, and test refactoring.

  - Fixing operator precedence in environment.

  - Updated copyright years.

  - Changed README example to use file:// URL.

  - Change ssh:// tests to file:// tests.

  - Refactored '[package]' substitution.

  - Implemented @ escaping in variables.

v0.1.46

  - Rakefile improvements.

  - Fixing broken reference to Fig::Logging in environment.rb.


v0.1.43-0.1.45

  - Rakefile improvements.

  - Test file refactoring/improvements.

  - Complains if it has nothing to do.

v0.1.42

  - Fig::Package refactoring.

  - "file:" protocol works for FIG_REMOTE_HOME.

  - Testing no longer requires ssh.

  - Implemented whitelist chceking after parse.

  - Simplify character classes in grammar, slight grammar refactoring.

  - Supports MacOS (better) in Rakefile.

  - No longer emits stack trace for invalid command line option(s).

  - Tests emits std(out|err) on failure, for ease in debugging test failures.


v0.1.41

  - Release cleanup


v0.1.40

  - Works on Mac (in conjunction with libarchive-static 1.0.1).

  - Supports configuration via rc files in JSON format.  These can be (in
    ascending order of priority of values):
      - in the repository under "_meta/figrc"
      - in your home directory in ".figrc"
      - specified on the command-line via the "--figrc" option

    Note that values from all the above locations will be merged into a
    single, net application configuration.  E.g. if
    <repository>/_meta/figrc contains

      {"a" => 5, "b" => 7"}

    and ~/.figrc contains

      {"a" => 37}

    then Fig will see a value for "a" of 37 and a value for "b" of 7.

    Processing of ~/.figrc can be suppressed via the "--no-figrc" option.

  - Supports logging via log4r. Configure via "log configuration" in the rc
    files or via the "--log-config" and "--log-level" command-line options.
    The configuration files must be in XML or YAML format in a way supported
    by log4r and contain configuration for a "fig" logger.  The "--log-level"
    will override any value found in the configuration files.

  - Added additional messages about activity including file download source
    and destination.  Try "--log-level debug".  Suggestions about changes to
    levels that are supported, which levels messages are emitted at, and any
    additional desired logging are welcome.

  - Supports "-v/--version" to emit the Fig version.

  - No longer silently does nothing when no arguments are specified.

  - Start of support for restricting URLs in package.fig files via a URL
    whitelist; not complete yet and will likely change.

  - RSpec usage has been upgraded to v2.
